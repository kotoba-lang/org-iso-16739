  "Run the buildingSMART IDS 1.0 implementer test corpus (Documentation/
  ImplementersDocumentation/TestCases in github.com/buildingSMART/IDS)
  against IFC data. Unlike `ifc.corpus-runner`, this does not fetch or pin
  a specific commit itself -- callers point BUILDINGSMART_IDS_TEST_CASES
  (or the first CLI arg) at a local checkout, so `expected-cases` reflects
  whatever revision was last verified here (last verified 2026-07-23
  against a fresh clone of the `development` branch: 291 cases, 0
  failures) and will legitimately drift as buildingSMART adds cases
  upstream -- a count mismatch alone is not a regression signal, only the
  `:ids-corpus/failed` count is."
